        <div>1) Hoisting</div>
        <div>
          Answer - refers to the process whereby the interpreter / compiler
          appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to
          the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

        <div>2) Scoping</div>
        <div>Answer - cope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global:
            <br/>
            Global variables are those declared outside of a block
            <br/>
            Local variables are those declared inside of a block</div>

        <div>4) - What are the two main differences in arrow functions?</div>
        <div>
          Normal Function <br />
          1) The execution context depends on how the function is invoked <br />
          2) These are hoisted <br />
          3) we can construct new object using <strong>new </strong> keyboard
        </div>
        <div>
          Arrow functions <br />
          1) It doesn't define its execution context so this value inside of an
          arrow function always equals this value from the outer function <br />
          2) These are not hoisted <br />
          3) A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function
          cannot be used as a constructor. so javascript throws erro

        <div>5) - Does Call apply bind work for arrow functions?</div>
        <div>No because arrow functions do not have their own this,</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>6) What does call apply bind do</div>
        <div>
          when we want a function to later be called with a certain context

      <li>
        <div>7)What are closures?</div>
        <div>
          It is a combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with
          references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
          other words we can say that local variables of outer fn can be
          accessed in inner fn

        <div>8)- What is event bubbling?</div>
        <div>
          Answer - Event bubbling is a type of event propagation[1] where the
          event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then
          successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element
          in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM
          element or document object

      <li>
        <div>9)- What is event loop</div>
        <div>
          Answer - An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue
          and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function
          stack becomes empty.

        <div>
          Answer - Suppose your birthday is coming and your parents has promised
          to give you bicycle. On the birthday date his promise will be either
          fulflilled or rejected. If he gets bicycle then promise is fulfilled,
          if not it was rejected and there was some error. There is also finally
          which is regardless of fulfilled or rejected, you will get to cut the
          cake which is finally

        <div>11)- what does async await mean?</div>
        <div>
          Answer - These are the keywords to write cleaner cleaner code instead
          of use .then and .catch. We declare async with a function and await is
          written in promise calls. We usually write it in try catch block

      <li>
        <div>12)- What does the this keyword mean?</div>
        <div>
          Answer - This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the
          current piece of code. It references the object that is executing the
          current function. If the function being referenced is a regular
          function, “this” references the global object

        <div>13)- What are classes? what are getters and setters?</div>
        <div>
          Answer - class is a blueprint for creating objects. JavaScript classes
          are syntactic sugar over the prototypal inheritance. In other words,
          ES6 classes are just special functions. Getters - We can get the
          propert of object using getter . Setter - by using set we can set
          propert of object

        </div>
        <div>
          Answer - Private instance fields are declared with # names, which are
          identifiers prefixed with #. Static - they are prepended by static

        <div>15)- What is currying?</div>
        <div>
          Answe - Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple
          arguments, into sequence of functions with single argument.In other
          words, when a function, instead of taking all arguments at one time,
          takes the first one and return a new function that takes the second
          one and returns a new function which takes the third one, and so
          forth, until all arguments have been fulfilled.
